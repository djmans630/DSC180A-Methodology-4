**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
So far, the most interesting topic covered in my domain has been the frequency bands of the brain, and how we can use them to classify and compare real vs. imagined movements within and between subjects. The frequency bands show up in all of the important graphs we have made, and being able to understand and interpret the different frequencies and how they correspond to movement or synchronization is interesting.


**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project.**
One way we could make good use of our EEG data is by determining BCI compatibility. BCIs have the potential to provide new ways to improve accessibility and help those who have lost muscle control due to some physical injury or condition. BCIs can interpret brain activity and transform it into some kind of action, and our dataset has the potential to work well in addressing who may be most compatible for interacting with BCIs. One idea I keep see popping up is that those whose brain activity on real vs. imagined movements is more similar will be able to better act with the BCI and potentially be able to make the most out of one. My idea for the quarter 2 project is to be able to check these differences and other features from EEG readings to determine compatibility, potentially opening the door to beneficial resources to those who have lost some physical capability or ability for the brain to communicate effectively with the muscles.  


**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In the quarter 1 project, my group and I were mostly focused on classification, which then turned into statistical comparison. I would like to narrow the scope further and work towards a clearer goal like the one I described above, rather than the mor exploratory approach we have taken so far. However, in recent weeks, we have been working on subject processing and a way to aggregate all of the subjects, so we are moving in the right direction for this quarter and this project idea.


**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
My group and I still plan on making use of the statistical comparisons and subject procesing pipeline, but more specifically I want to use the frequency bands and changes to indicate brain activity on the tested action (or imagined action), determine what constitutes real and imagined action activity for the different bands at different times for a subject, repeat that for all of the subjects, aggregate and combine the data to get a clearer picture of activity levels that constitute real and imagined movements, and from that be able to determine which subjects have more potential to successfully use a BCI using statistical comparisons and similarity between brain activity across trials. Other factors that may be significant are noise and absolute value of activity readings.
